The **Admin Page** in your platform serves as the **central control panel** for managing and monitoring all activities across the decentralized investment system. Its primary purpose is to **moderate, approve, and oversee** user-generated content and system integrity. Here's what a fully functional admin page **should do**:

* **Analytics View**: Graphs showing investment trends
* **Manual Token Minting** (for emergencies)
* **Blockchain Sync Checker**: Ensure on-chain state matches database

### 🛠️ Your Current State

From what you've built so far:

* You have KYC and campaign approval
* Admin dashboard already loads users and campaigns

You can now **expand this base** with buttons/forms to:

* Approve KYC directly (`POST /admin/kyc/approve/:id`)
* Approve campaign requests
* Show a summarized status panel
