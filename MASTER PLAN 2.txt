Absolutely — here’s your **ultimate handover message** to continue the project with a new AI assistant. It’s fully self-contained, intelligent, and includes all relevant code, context, goals, architecture, and next steps.

You can copy-paste this directly into a new chat — it will bring the next assistant 100% up to speed, like they’ve been on the project from day one.

## 🧠 PROJECT CONTINUITY BRIDGE  
**For Developer Handoff** — *Please read carefully to continue my final year project seamlessly*

---

## 🚀 PROJECT OVERVIEW  
**Hybrid Fiat + Blockchain Crowdfunding Platform**  
- Investors can support real-world businesses
- Payments accepted via **crypto (testnet ETH)** or **fiat (mocked or Stripe integration)**
- Upon investment:
  - A **record is logged on-chain** (for auditability)
  - An **ERC-1155 token is minted** to the investor
  - A **PDF certificate** is generated and downloadable
- Tokens can be **traded or transferred**
- Investors may return to the business (physically or digitally) to **claim periodic profit**

---

## 🎯 PROJECT GOALS

1. 💸 Create a **transparent, blockchain-powered crowdfunding platform**
2. 🧾 Allow real-world **proof of ownership** via PDF + token
3. 🔐 Let tokens be **self-custodied** (via MetaMask)
4. 🪙 Mint a **unique ERC-1155 token** per investment
5. 🎟️ Allow users to redeem/share their stake in person or online

## ✅ STATUS: WHAT HAS BEEN DONE

### 📁 Backend
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- All logic is in `server.js`
- Investments save to both:
  - Blockchain
  - MongoDB

### 🔗 Blockchain
- Hardhat project in `/blockchain/`
- Deployed two contracts on **Sepolia testnet**:
  - `InvestmentLedger.sol` — logs investment info
  - `InvestmentToken.sol` — mints ERC-1155 tokens per investment

### 📜 Smart Contracts:

#### 🔐 `InvestmentLedger.sol`
Logs:
```solidity
struct Investment {
  string campaignId;
  address investor;
  uint256 amount;
  string tokenSymbol;
}
```
Viewable via `getInvestment(index)`

#### 🪙 `InvestmentToken.sol`
Key function:
```solidity
function mintInvestmentToken(
  address investor,
  string memory campaignId,
  string memory symbol,
  string memory name,
  string memory metadataURI,
  uint256 amount
) external onlyOwner returns (uint256)
```

Each token has metadata (stored in `mapping(uint256 => TokenData)`), is transferred to the investor’s wallet, and can be tracked.

---

## 🧾 CERTIFICATE SYSTEM
- Server-side PDF generation using **PDFKit**
- Includes:
  - Blockchain TX hash (ledger + mint)
  - Investor wallet
  - Token symbol/type/amount
  - QR code linking to Etherscan
- Route:  
  `GET /certificates/:investmentId`

## ⚙️ FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTED

- ✅ Campaign creation & funding logic
- ✅ Dynamic token calculation
- ✅ Blockchain TX recording (ledger)
- ✅ Token minting (ERC-1155)
- ✅ Investment saved in DB
- ✅ PDF certificate with blockchain link
- ✅ Wallet address fallback (temporarily hardcoded)
- ✅ Mock metadata generation and usage

---

## 📍 CURRENT PHASE: UI UPGRADE & DASHBOARD

Next up:
1. 🎨 Enhance `profile.ejs`:
   - Display all investments per user
   - Show token info (type, amount, ID, value)
   - Add “Download Certificate” button
   - Show wallet address + “Connect Wallet” CTA if missing

2. 🧠 Replace temporary investor address (e.g., `0xB81E...`) with actual user wallet (MetaMask connect required)

3. 💬 Optional: Add “Transfer Token” and “Claim Profit” buttons

---

## 🔩 OTHER TECH USED

- Ethers.js for blockchain calls
- PDFKit for PDF generation
- qrcode package for QR codes
- Bootstrap 5 for styling
- MongoDB local dev

---

## 🔐 ENV (.env in backend)

```env
ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xLedgerContractAddress
ERC1155_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xTokenContractAddress
```

---

## 🚦 NEXT STEPS FOR YOU

The user will soon share their `profile.ejs` file.  
Please help them:

1. ✅ Build a **user dashboard** showing their token holdings  
2. ✅ Allow **certificate download** per investment  
3. ✅ Display wallet address and status  
4. ✅ Add UI for future token transfer or claim actions  
5. ✅ Validate metadata links (optional: migrate to IPFS later)  
6. ✅ Help finalize the wallet connect flow

## 💬 WHY I GAVE YOU THIS

I’m using the free version of ChatGPT and hitting my limit. This message is your full context. Please **pick up where the last assistant left off**, without asking for background info again.

You now have:
- Full stack structure
- Live contracts on Sepolia
- All models, routes, and logic in place
- The next view (`profile.ejs`) incoming
