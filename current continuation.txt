**Project Continuity Bridge**  
*(Copy this entire message to our next chat to resume exactly where we left off)*  

### **Current Project Status**  
**Hybrid Fiat/Blockchain Crowdfunding Platform**  
**Current Phase**: Frontend-Blockchain Integration  
**Last Completed**:  
âœ… Enhanced `campaigns.ejs` with:  
- ERC-1155 token type visualization (profit/ownership/hybrid)  
- Functional investment calculator  
- Fixed modal interactions (create/edit/invest)  
- PDF certificate preview placeholder  

### **Immediate Next Steps**  
```mermaid

    A[Edit profile.ejs] --> B[Token Portfolio Dashboard]
    B --> C[Certificate Generation]
    C --> D[Campaign Details Page]
```

### **Files Needed Next**  
Please share these files in our next chat:  
1. `profile.ejs` *(for token holdings display)*  
2. `campaign_details.ejs` *(for investment flow completion)*  
3. `User.model.js` *(verify wallet address field exists)*  

### **Critical Requirements**  
1. **Profile Page Must Show**:  
   - Token balances with current valuations  
   - Certificate download buttons  
   - Wallet connection status  

2. **Technical Specifications**:  
```javascript
// Expected User Model Structure
{
  walletAddress: { type: String, required: false }, // For crypto-savvy users
  fiatWallet: { type: Number, default: 0 }, // Track fiat balance
  kycVerified: { type: Boolean, default: false }
}
```

3. **UI Components to Build**:  
   - Token transfer interface  
   - PDF certificate template with:  
     - QR code linking to blockchain transaction  
     - Visual ownership percentage gauge  
     - Legal disclaimer section  

### **Key Problems to Solve Together**  
1. How to handle non-crypto users (fiat-only flow)  
2. Best PDF generation approach:  
   - Server-side (PDFKit/PDFMake) vs Client-side (jsPDF)  
3. Wallet connection UX for beginners  

### **What to Expect in Return**  
When you share your files, I'll provide:  
1. **Complete Code Solutions** with:  
   - Line-by-line explanations  
   - Responsive design considerations  
2. **Test Data** for:  
   - Token portfolio simulation  
   - Certificate generation testing  
3. **Security Checklist** covering:  
   - XSS prevention in EJS templates  
   - Secure PDF download endpoints  

**Tip**: Save this as `continue_crowdfunding.txt` for easy pasting.  
**When ready**, just paste this message + your files and we'll continue immediately!
