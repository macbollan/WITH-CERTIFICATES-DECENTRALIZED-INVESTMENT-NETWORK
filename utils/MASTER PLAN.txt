## 🧠 FINAL PROJECT CONTINUITY HANDOVER MESSAGE  

**Project Title:**  
🔗 *Hybrid Fiat + Blockchain Crowdfunding Platform with Tradeable Profit-Share Tokens & Verifiable Certificates*  

---

### ✅ Current Phase:
**ERC-1155 Integration & Certificate Automation**

---

## 🔧 Project Summary:
This platform allows **investors to support real-world startups or businesses** using fiat or crypto. For every investment:

- A **token is minted** (ERC-1155 standard) representing their share
- A **blockchain-linked PDF certificate** is generated as proof
- Tokens can be **traded or used to redeem periodic profit claims**
- **Investments are recorded on-chain** for public verifiability
- All this runs on a **testnet (Sepolia)** for full functionality without cost

## 📁 Models Overview

### `User.model.js` *(partial, needs extension)*

```js
{
  username: String,
  surname: String,
  email: String,
  phone: String,
  address: String,
  age: Number,
  gender: { type: String, enum: ['Male', 'Female'] },
  bio: String,
  profilePicture: String,
  password: String,

  // Extend with:
  walletAddress: {
    type: String,
    validate: {
      validator: v => /^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/.test(v),
      message: 'Invalid Ethereum address'
    }
  },
  fiatBalance: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  kycStatus: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["unverified", "pending", "verified"],
    default: "unverified"
  }
}
```

### `Campaign.model.js`

```js
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  image: String,
  goalAmount: Number,
  amountRaised: Number,
  status: { type: String, enum: ["active", "funded", "closed"], default: "active" },

{
  investor: { type: ObjectId, ref: "User" },
  campaign: { type: ObjectId, ref: "Campaign" },
  amount: Number,
  tokens: Number,

  tokenDetails: {
    name: String,
    symbol: String,
    type: String,
    value: Number,
    metadata: Schema.Types.Mixed
  },

  blockchainCampaignId: String,
  transactionHash: String,
  tokenId: Number,  // NEW: ERC-1155 token ID
  timeCreated: Date
}
```

---

## 🔗 Blockchain Overview

### ✅ Current On-Chain Logger: `InvestmentLedger.sol`

- Records every investment (campaignId, investor, amount, tokenSymbol)
- Accessible via `getInvestment(index)` or events
- Used for **PDF verification & transparency**
- Not responsible for actual token balances

---

### 🆕 To Add: `InvestmentToken.sol` (ERC-1155)

Requirements:
- `mintInvestmentToken(address, campaignId, symbol, metadataURI, amount)`
- Maps `tokenId => InvestmentData`
- Must return tokenId to the backend
- Should override `uri(tokenId)` for OpenSea/MetaMask compatibility
- Deployed on **Sepolia testnet**

---

## 📄 Certificate PDF Logic (Already Implemented)

Generated with:
- Investor name & wallet
- Token type, amount
- Campaign title
- Blockchain TX hash
- QR Code linking to Etherscan

📍 Route:
```js
/certificates/:investmentId
```

📄 Tooling:
- PDFKit
- qrcode
- Streams PDF to browser directly

---

## 🧩 Frontend Flow

### `campaigns.ejs`
- Grid of campaigns
- Progress bars
- Token symbol/type
- View/Edit buttons

### `profile.ejs`
- List of investments
- Token summary per campaign
- **Download certificate** button
- Future: Claim profit / transfer token

### `campaign_details.ejs`
- Investment calculator
- Token preview
- Submit investment flow

---

## 💰 Claiming Profit

Planned Claim Flow:
1. User visits startup physically
   - Shows wallet with ERC-1155 token
   - Startup verifies tokenId on-chain
2. OR user uses **“Claim”** in profile
   - Backend checks `balanceOf(user, tokenId)`
   - Logs claim, updates redemption history

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap (Last Stretch)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Deploy ERC-1155 Contract] --> B[Mint on Investment]
  B --> C[Update Mongo Investment Schema with tokenId]
  C --> D[Update Certificate PDF with tokenId]
  D --> E[Display Tokens in profile.ejs]
  E --> F[Implement Transfer + Claim UI]
```

---

## ✅ Technical Requirements Met:
- 💬 PDF generation with QR → tx hash ✔️
- 🔐 Investment recorded on-chain ✔️
- 🔄 Tokenomics: profit/ownership/reward ✔️
- 📦 Campaign creation & metadata ✔️
- 🆓 100% Testnet only (Sepolia) ✔️

---

## 🚀 What You Should Do Next

1. Finalize & deploy `InvestmentToken.sol`
2. Integrate `mintInvestmentToken()` into `/campaigns/invest`
3. Add tokenId field to `Investment.model.js`
4. Generate and host metadata JSON per investment
5. Update `profile.ejs` to show:
   - Token type
   - `tokenId`
   - Ownership %
   - Transfer / Claim buttons (optional)
6. Test on Sepolia with MetaMask + QR verification

---

## 🧠 Summary Pitch (Use in Report/Presentation)

> “We built a hybrid crowdfunding platform that issues ERC-1155 tokens representing real investment stakes. Each token is backed by an on-chain investment log and a tamper-proof PDF certificate. Investors can redeem profits in person or online and trade their tokens freely on the blockchain.”

---

## ❗ Notes
- All blockchain code lives in the `/blockchain/` folder.
- All backend logic is currently in `server.js`.
- PDF generation does NOT require external storage; it's streamed.
- Token metadata can be hosted via IPFS or a simple express route.
- The whole platform is designed for **testnet-only** use (Sepolia).
